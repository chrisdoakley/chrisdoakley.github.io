                <h4>One Tree Planted</h4>
                <p>While undertaking an Ara Visual Design course, I was required to design a one-page flyer to promote One Tree Planted. This is an organisation that encourages businesses to invest in the planting of trees where forest fires have occurred.</p>

                <p>A Substack article I wrote about Chris Rea, just a few weeks after his passing. It suggests that many people have a particular perception of who he was and the music he made, but that there was more to him than meets the eye.</p>
